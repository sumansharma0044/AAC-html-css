        <div class="processhead">What Is an Animal Shelter?</div><br>
        <div class="processtext">An animal shelter is a staffed facility where homeless animals—and animals
            seized by authorities in cruelty cases—find safety and comfort, are cared for, and are made available
            for adoption. Temporarily housing animals in shelters keeps them from being loose on the streets,
            where they struggle to find clean food and water, can be hit by cars, can be attacked by other animals
            or cruel humans, or face other potential dangers.

            Animal shelters vary greatly—by size, purpose, capacity, and their treatment of the animals in their
            charge. They may be operated by the government, a local humane society, private individuals, or a
            combination of these. Some are funded by donations alone, while others receive tax money.

            Dogs, cats, and all animals are individuals, not property, which is why they should never be bought
            from pet stores, websites, or breeders. At reputable animal shelters, animals are spayed or neutered
            before they’re adopted so as not to add to the animal overpopulation crisis.</div>

        <div class="processhead">What Do Animal Shelters Do? </div><br>
        <div class="processtext">At professionally run facilities, frightened animals are reassured, sick and
            injured animals receive treatment or a peaceful end to their suffering, and the animals’ living quarters
            are kept clean and dry.<br><br>

                <li>A spay/neuter program that ensures all animals are sterilized at the time of adoption or that
                    guarantees all
