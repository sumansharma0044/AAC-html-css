        <div class="processhead">How to Adopt a Animal : 6 Steps to Follow</div><br>
        <div class="processtext">Are you a human looking forward to give a animal his/her forever home? You might be
            having sleepless nights researching how to welcome your perfect furry companion. Well, contrary to popular
            belief, the process of adopting a dog in India has become way simpler than before.

            The Better India got in touch with Sandhya Madappa, the founder of Compassion Unlimited Plus Action (CUPA),
            Bengaluru, who detailed the basic steps to follow for dog adoption in India.</div>

        <div class="processhead">Step 1: Decide the kind of dog you want</div><br>
        <div class="processtext">Keep in mind your lifestyle, budget, home space and your family before you decide which
            kind of dog you want to bring home. While families with kids or young couples might opt for a lively dog,
            seniors can go for aged canines who require less training and can be ideal retirement companions.

            A large dog is not suitable for people residing in less spacious apartments. At the same time, they also
            have to ensure zero inconvenience to the neighbours.</div>
        <br>
    </div>

    <div class="process">
        <div class="processhead">Step 2: Find out the nearby shelters</div><br>
        <div class="processtext">Decide whether you can devote time to raise a puppy or if a trained, adult dog suits
            you better. Locate the nearby dog shelter and visit the place several times keeping in mind who you want in
            your home.</div>
        <br>
    </div>

    <div class="process">
        <div class="processhead">Step 3: Bond with the dogs at the shelter</div><br>
        <div class="processtext">Interact with the dogs at the shelter. Ask the shelter keepers about their individual
            temperament and history. Enquire about their behaviour with humans and other animals.

            Ideally, visit the shelter a couple of times and bond with your ‘chosen one’ before adopting her/him. Make
            an informed decision in the end.</div>
        <br>
    </div>


    <div class="process">
        <div class="processhead">Step 4: Secure the medical records</div><br>
        <div class="processtext">Ensure that your dog is properly vaccinated. Ask the shelter to provide the medical
            records of the dog, detailing past illnesses or injuries/traumas, if any.</div>
        <br>
    </div>


    <div class="process">
        <div class="processhead">Step 5: Follow the official adoption procedure</div><br>
        <div class="processtext">Most shelters follow a specific adoption procedure involving an adoption form and
            submission of other certificates. The adoption form might ask questions about taking the dog to the vet,
            caring at home, vacation plans etc, as well as about the worst-case scenario – if you have to give up the
            dog some time in the future. You will also be asked to provide your original identity documents and address
            proof.</div>
        <br>
    </div>

    <div class="process">
        <div class="processhead">Step 6: Take your fur baby home</div><br>
        <div class="processtext">After requisite background checks and counselling, the shelter will finally hand over
            the dog to you. However, it might take the dog some time to acclimatise to the home environment. For some,
            it might be just a few days, while other dogs can take up to a few months. Have patience and continue
            showering your baby with all the love you can.</div>
