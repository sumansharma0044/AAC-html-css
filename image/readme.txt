Wish List
SGACC is a community-driven nonprofit, and for us to continue helping animals, we need your help. We house over 3000 animals, and need to upgrade our facilities.
Our wishlist has a range of items that can cost less than a meal out! We need fans, coolers, blankets, buckets, heaters, dog beds, food bowls, bird feeders, toys, chew sticks, and so much more. You might even have some them lying around unused at home. Help us help animals?

Volunteer
Would you like to volunteer at a local shelter or animal rescue organization? Walk dogs, feed animals, organise fundraising events, foster abused or frightened animals? Come join us and help make a difference.
Would you like to help us promote the Animal Birth Control Programme (ABC)? By spaying and neutering your own dog, as well as the dogs in your community, you are helping Delhi become rabies-free. We have a low-cost spay/neuter programme and work with the municipality. Help us spread the word to more communities and neighbourhoods.
Would you like to start a neighborhood watch program? Get to know the animals in your neighborhood and invite your friends and neighbours to do the same. Together, you can keep an eye out for any cruelty – abuse and neglect of companion animals, constantly tied up pets, the mistreatment of colony dogs, and other signs of abuse. Regularly feed the dogs and animals in your area and turn your community animal friendly.

Sponsor an Animal
If you do not have place in your home, you can still make room in your heart by paying for the upkeep of an animal in the shelter. This will enable us to provide refuge and comfort to more needy animals. Pick an animal of your choice from the list below and contribute towards his monthly upkeep.
You can visit our shelter and choose a lucky animal, or leave that to us.

What Is an Animal Shelter?
An animal shelter is a staffed facility where homeless animals—and animals seized by authorities in cruelty cases—find safety and comfort, are cared for, and are made available for adoption. Temporarily housing animals in shelters keeps them from being loose on the streets, where they struggle to find clean food and water, can be hit by cars, can be attacked by other animals or cruel humans, or face other potential dangers.

Animal shelters vary greatly—by size, purpose, capacity, and their treatment of the animals in their charge. They may be operated by the government, a local humane society, private individuals, or a combination of these. Some are funded by donations alone, while others receive tax money.

Dogs, cats, and all animals are individuals, not property, which is why they should never be bought from pet stores, websites, or breeders. At reputable animal shelters, animals are spayed or neutered before they’re adopted so as not to add to the animal overpopulation crisis.


What Do Animal Shelters Do? 
At professionally run facilities, frightened animals are reassured, sick and injured animals receive treatment or a peaceful end to their suffering, and the animals’ living quarters are kept clean and dry.

REPUTABLE ANIMAL SHELTERS TYPICALLY HAVE MANY OF THE FOLLOWING:
A compassionate trained staff (plus volunteers) to care for animals
A sick ward and isolation area for animals who may be ill
A pre-adoption home check and follow-up program
A humane method of euthanasia, usually an intravenous injection of sodium pentobarbital, administered by well-trained, gentle staff members
A policy against giving or selling animals to laboratories or to be used as guard dogs
Cruelty investigators
A veterinarian on call 24 hours a day
Indoor/outdoor dog runs
A large, sunny cat room with raised perches for sitting and individual cages for cats who must be confined
A quiet room for adopters to meet and get to know animals
An active public education program to teach children and adults to care for animals properly
A spay/neuter program that ensures all animals are sterilized at the time of adoption or that guarantees all adopted animals will be sterilized later
A policy of holding lost and stray animals for a minimum of five days, including at least one Saturday

Are There Different Types of Animal Shelters?
Not all animal shelters are the same. Fortunate homeless and unwanted animals end up in a traditional, high-intake open-admission animal shelter staffed by professional, caring people.

Many less fortunate animals end up in pitiful kennels that are nothing more than severely crowded shacks without walls or other protection from the elements, where animals are often left to die from exposure, disease, or fights with other animals.

Some shelters promote dangerous “no-kill” policies, which, ironically, don’t prevent animals from dying. They simply leave animals to die elsewhere—and often miserably. Facilities that adhere to these policies try not to involve themselves in euthanasia by turning away animals in need, shipping animals out of state to unknown and often untraceable destinations, or warehousing animals in cages indefinitely. “No-kill” shelters often prioritize the appearance of their “save rates” above the needs of animals in their charge.




Important Things to Consider Before Adopting a ‘Pet’
Adopting an animal companion means making a long-term commitment to care for and spend time with the animal for his or her entire life. Before adopting, consider the time and money involved in proper animal care. Will someone have the time and patience to exercise and train the animal? Is someone prepared to pay for food, accessories (such as toys, grooming supplies, leashes and harnesses, and bedding), inoculations, and veterinary care, including spaying or neutering, flea treatment, deworming, and emergency care? Can someone provide for the animal in case of your absence?

If a family decides to adopt an animal, every family member should go to the local shelter together to choose the animal, after the obligations and long-term commitments involved have been carefully considered. It’s also necessary to be aware of local, state, and federal regulations that govern animal “ownership.” Most communities require annual licensing for dogs and cats, and many require that animals be on the custodian’s property at all times and that they be spayed or neutered.



What You Can Do   
Finding a home for one dog or cat is a wonderful thing, but sterilizing one dog or cat will potentially spare hundreds (if not thousands) of animals suffering and death by preventing generations of puppies and kittens from being born. Getting spay/neuter laws passed saves even more lives.

Stopping the problem at its source is where our time, energy, and funds are needed most. That’s how we can drastically reduce—and hopefully end—the homeless-animal crisis and the need for euthanasia because of overpopulation.
